Create a publication quality (i.e., legible labels, no title, etc.) map figure related to your thesis/dissertation research.  This could be a study site map showing, for example, where your samples were collected.  If you really don't have anything to map, you can work with your partner to map their data.

The map could be raster, point, or lattice/polygon.  You're welcome to use any packages you choose, but be sure to list them all near the top of your code with library().

Please submit a link to a new, working GitHub repository (not a single R file) containing code to create the maps for you and your partner.  One submission per group.  The group member(s) not submitting the repo should submit the names of their partners.
